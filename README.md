# shorts
Random projects consisting of a single (or very few) source files

## contents
- `dump.fish`: small-scale version of Compiler Explorer
- `list_vs_array.py`: arrays are better than linked lists at random insertion on modern hardware and N < 1M elements

All other folders contain WIP projects that should be moved elsewhere.
